   - Check your current booking and either cancel or edit it.
   - View a read-only list of your booking history.

2. **Booking Services**:
   - Create new bookings using our calendar picker and select your desired time slot.
   - Confirm your booking easily with the 'Book Now' button.

3. **Chatbot Commands**:
   - If you want to **show your profile**, just type "Show my profile."
   - To **book an appointment**, you can say "I want to book."
   - For managing bookings, you can use commands like "Cancel my last booking" or "Update the date for my upcoming booking."
